# Args

Some args can be given to the programs

## Output moves

```bash
--output-moves /path/to/output/moves
```

This argument tells the program to save the moves done to a file.

> **Note:** This argument can be useful to keep track of what game has been done.

> **Second note:** The moves will be added to the program for EACH move.
